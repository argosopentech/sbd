{"lang_code": "en", "q": "The black-and-yellow broadbill (Eurylaimus ochromalus) is a species of bird in Eurylaimidae, the typical broadbill family. It is small, with a black head, breastband, and upperparts, a white neckband, yellow streaking on the back and wings, and wine-pink underparts that turn yellow towards the belly. The beak is bright blue, with a green tip to the upper mandible and black edges. The black breastband is incomplete in females. The black-and-yellow broadbill occurs in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, in lowland forests up to an elevation of 1,220 m (4,000 ft). It is mainly insectivorous, but also eats molluscs and some fruit. It breeds during the dry season with both sexes helping build a large, untidy nest from moss, fungal mycelia, and leaves. The clutch is usually 2–3 eggs, and sometimes includes a fourth runt egg. They are incubated by both sexes. The species is listed as near-threatened by the IUCN due to a decline in its population caused by habitat loss.", "split_sentences": ["The black-and-yellow broadbill (Eurylaimus ochromalus) is a species of bird in Eurylaimidae, the typical broadbill family.
